#The Daily Blank Wordpress Theme
by Alan Levine http://cogdog.info/ or http://cogdogblog.com/

## What is this?
A Wordpress Theme that provides a site that works like the [ds106 Daily Create](http://tdc.ds106.us) Unlike the TDC where responses needed to be posted to social media sites, for the Daily Blank participation is via sending a tweet to a dedicated account with a link and a specific hash tag

## How to Install
I will make the big leap in that you have a self hosted Wordpress site and can install themes. The Daily Blank is a child theme based on [Wordpress Bootstrap](https://github.com/320press/wordpress-bootstrap) You can grab the most current version from there, I provide the one un this repositoy to create this first version.

Very very crucial. Do not just use the zip of this repo as a theme upload. It will not work. If you are uploading in the wordpress admin, you will need to make separate zips of the two themes (comparator and wordpress-bootstrap, and upload each.
