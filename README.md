#The Daily Blank Wordpress Theme
by Alan Levine http://cogdog.info/ or http://cogdogblog.com/

## What is this?
A Wordpress Theme that provides a site that works like the [ds106 Daily Create](http://tdc.ds106.us) Unlike the TDC where responses needed to be posted to social media sites, in the Daily Blank participation is accomplished by sending a tweet to a dedicated account with a link and a specific hash tag.

Look for a working prototype in progress at [The Daily Blank](http://splot.ca/dailyblank)

## How to Install
I will make the big leap in that you have a self hosted Wordpress site and can install themes. The Daily Blank is a child theme based on [Wordpress Bootstrap](https://github.com/320press/wordpress-bootstrap) You can grab the most current version from there, I provide the one in this repositoy to create this first version.

Very very crucial. Do not just use the zip of this repo as a theme upload. It will not work. If you are uploading in the wordpress admin, you will need to make separate zips of the two themes (comparator and wordpress-bootstrap) and upload each to the the theme directory. Install the oAuth plugin in your plugins directory as you would normally.

## What Else You Will Need to Do

* Create a developer app for your Daily Blank [get oAuth keys](https://apps.twitter.com/)
